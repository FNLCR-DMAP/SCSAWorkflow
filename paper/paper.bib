    abstract = {Limitations on the number of unique protein and DNA molecules that can be characterized microscopically in a single tissue specimen impede advances in understanding the biological basis of health and disease. Here we present a multiplexed fluorescence microscopy method (MxIF) for quantitative, single-cell, and subcellular characterization of multiple analytes in formalin-fixed paraffinembedded tissue. Chemical inactivation of fluorescent dyes after each image acquisition round allows reuse of common dyes in iterative staining and imaging cycles. The mild inactivation chemistry is compatible with total and phosphoprotein detection, as well as DNA FISH. Accurate computational registration of sequential images is achieved by aligning nuclear counterstain-derived fiducial points. Individual cells, plasma membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, tumor, and stromal regions are segmented to achieve cellular and subcellular quantification of multiplexed targets. In a comparison of pathologist scoring of diaminobenzidine staining of serial sections and automated MxIF scoring of a single section, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, estrogen receptor, p53, and androgen receptor staining by diaminobenzidine and MxIF methods yielded similar results. Single-cell staining patterns of 61 protein antigens by MxIF in 747 colorectal cancer subjects reveals extensive tumor heterogeneity, and cluster analysis of divergent signaling through ERK1/2, S6 kinase 1, and 4E binding protein 1 provides insights into the spatial organization of mechanistic target of rapamycin and MAPK signal transduction. Our results suggest MxIF should be broadly applicable to problems in the fields of basic biological research, drug discovery and development, and clinical diagnostics.},

    abstract = {Multiplexed imaging data are revolutionizing our understanding of the composition and organization of tissues and tumors. A critical aspect of such tissue profiling is quantifying the spatial relationship relationships among cells at different scales from the interaction of neighboring cells to recurrent communities of cells of multiple types. This often involves statistical analysis of 10^7 or more cells in which up to 100 biomolecules (commonly proteins) have been measured. While software tools currently cater to the analysis of spatial transcriptomics data, there remains a need for toolkits explicitly tailored to the complexities of multiplexed imaging data including the need to seamlessly integrate image visualization with data analysis and exploration. We introduce SCIMAP, a Python package specifically crafted to address these challenges. With SCIMAP, users can efficiently preprocess, analyze, and visualize large datasets, facilitating the exploration of spatial relationships and their statistical significance. SCIMAP's modular design enables the integration of new algorithms, enhancing its capabilities for spatial analysis.},

CODEX iteratively visualizes antibody binding events using DNA barcodes, fluorescent dNTP analogs, and an in situ polymerization-based indexing procedure. An algorithmic pipeline for single-cell antigen quantification in tightly packed tissues was developed and used to overlay well-known morphological features with de novo characterization of lymphoid tissue architecture at a single-cell and cellular neighborhood levels. We observed an unexpected, profound impact of the cellular neighborhood on the expression of protein receptors on immune cells. By comparing normal murine spleen to spleens from animals with systemic autoimmune disease (MRL/lpr), extensive and previously uncharacterized splenic cell-interaction dynamics in the healthy versus diseased state was observed. The fidelity of multiplexed spatial cytometry demonstrated here allows for quantitative systemic characterization of tissue architecture in normal and clinically aberrant samples. A DNA barcoding-based imaging technique uses multiplexed tissue antigen staining to enable the characterization of cell types and dynamics in a model of autoimmune disease.},

    abstract = {Multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) can detail spatial relationships and complex cell phenotypes in the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the analysis and visualization of mIF data can be complex and time-consuming. Here, we used tumor specimens from 93 patients with metastatic melanoma to develop and validate a mIF data analysis pipeline using established flow cytometry workflows (image cytometry). Unlike flow cytometry, spatial information from the TME was conserved at single-cell resolution. A spatial uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) was constructed using the image cytometry output. Spatial UMAP subtraction analysis (survivors vs. nonsurvivors at 5 years) was used to identify topographic and coexpression signatures with positive or negative prognostic impact. Cell densities and proportions identified by image cytometry showed strong correlations when compared with those obtained using gold-standard, digital pathology software (R2 > 0.8). The associated spatial UMAP highlighted “immune neighborhoods” and associated topographic immunoactive protein expression patterns. We found that PD-L1 and PD-1 expression intensity was spatially encoded—the highest PD-L1 expression intensity was observed on CD163+ cells in neighborhoods with high CD8+ cell density, and the highest PD-1 expression intensity was observed on CD8+ cells in neighborhoods with dense arrangements of tumor cells. Spatial UMAP subtraction analysis revealed numerous spatial clusters associated with clinical outcome. The variables represented in the key clusters from the unsupervised UMAP analysis were validated using established, supervised approaches. In conclusion, image cytometry and the spatial UMAPs presented herein are powerful tools for the visualization and interpretation of single-cell, spatially resolved mIF data and associated topographic biomarker development.},

It combines graph neural networks with self-supervised contrastive learning to learn informative and discriminative spot representations by minimizing the embedding distance between spatially adjacent spots and vice versa. We demonstrated GraphST on multiple tissue types and technology platforms. GraphST achieved 10% higher clustering accuracy and better delineated fine-grained tissue structures in brain and embryo tissues. GraphST is also the only method that can jointly analyze multiple tissue slices in vertical or horizontal integration while correcting batch effects. Lastly, GraphST demonstrated superior cell-type deconvolution to capture spatial niches like lymph node germinal centers and exhausted tumor infiltrating T cells in breast tumor tissue.},

Here, we introduce “weighted-nearest neighbor” analysis, an unsupervised framework to learn the relative utility of each data type in each cell, enabling an integrative analysis of multiple modalities. We apply our procedure to a CITE-seq dataset of 211,000 human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with panels extending to 228 antibodies to construct a multimodal reference atlas of the circulating immune system. Multimodal analysis substantially improves our ability to resolve cell states, allowing us to identify and validate previously unreported lymphoid subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate how to leverage this reference to rapidly map new datasets and to interpret immune responses to vaccination and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our approach represents a broadly applicable strategy to analyze single-cell multimodal datasets and to look beyond the transcriptome toward a unified and multimodal definition of cellular identity.},

A scRNA-seq of CD45 <sup>+</sup> cells from 23 GBM tissue samples showed 15 (65.2%) were positive for MAIT cells and the enrichment of MAIT17. The MAIT cell signature significantly correlated with the activity of tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Multiple immune suppressive genes known to be used by TANs/MDSCs were upregulated in MAIT-positive tumors. Spatial imaging analysis of GBM tissues showed that all specimens were positive for both MAIT cells and TANs and localized enrichment of TANs.
